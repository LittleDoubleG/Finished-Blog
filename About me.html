<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

<h2> My name is George Giannakopoulos. I am 15 years old and I love to play basketball. Originally, my favourite sport was football but when I picked up a basketball for the first time it was life changing. I immediately knew that I wanted to play the sport. Sometimes when I'm in class, I go off into my own little world in my head and imagine myself in the NBA. That's my dream, to play in the NBA. Due to Covid-19 there has been a lot of restrictions with gym time so it's been hard for me to play. But I've still been working out keeping in shape so when that moments comes where everything is normal agian, it'll be like I never skipped a beat.</h2>
