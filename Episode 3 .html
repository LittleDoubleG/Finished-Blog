<h1>Episode 3...Who You Calling Ugly?</h1>

<h1>(Spoiler Alert)</h1>

<h2>After a televised funeral, the Graysons attend the Guardians' private burial with their abandoned loved ones. Darkblood questions Nolan privately, hinting at his suspicions. Cecil commissions Robot to form a new Guardians roster of his choosing, given his handling of the Flaxans, and Robot merges the Teen Team with Monster Girl, Black Samson, and Shrinking Rae to form the new Guardians. However, Eve quits as she is still resentful of Rex Splode, having caught him cheating with Dupli-Kate after returning from the funeral. After Mark gets Amber's phone number, he sets up a "study date", but he is interrupted for an hour to help Eve stop Doc Seismic from attacking Mt. Rushmore. Despite making Amber wait, she still stays for their date. When Rex tries apologizing, Eve refuses to accept and leaves to find Mark, only to find him with Amber. With Robot's unseen help, the Mauler Twins escape from prison, though one of them is sacrificed for the other. When Darkblood questions Debbie, he finds Nolan omitted details from her. She goes to bed suspicious of Nolan, who senses Darkblood's lingering presence.
