<h1>Episode 5...That Actually Hurt</h1>

<h1>(Spoiler Alert)</h1>

<h2>As Debbie finds Darkblood's notepad, his notes correspond to her suspicions, and she finds the incriminating evidence while Nolan goes on a timely errand. After Black Samson berates and lectures the others for allowing civilian injuries to multiply from fighting individually, Robot secretly approaches the Maulers with a job offer. Meanwhile, Mark promises to help Amber at a soup kitchen as recompense for his time being Invincible ruining her trust in him with tardiness. However, he must also help Titan defeat his crime boss, Machine Head, who predicted their attack and hired multiple villains for security. The Guardians arrive to help but are promptly overwhelmed by Thokk, the Battle Beast, brutalizing them. Seeing the other villains swiftly defeated, Thokk is disgusted by the battle's ignominy and departs via a portal, allowing the GDA to arrest Machine Head. After Invincible and others are MEDEVACed, Titan then takes over Machine Head's operation. Eve also volunteers to serve at the soup kitchen with Amber, needing direction after fighting with her parents and quitting being a superhero. But she leaves when Cecil calls about Mark's hospitalization. Elsewhere, GDA scientists test some of Mark's blood, finding the cells invulnerable to every lethal test they run.
