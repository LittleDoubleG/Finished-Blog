<h1>Episode 1... It's About Time</h1>

<h1>(Spoiler Alert)</h1>

<h2>The Mauler Twins attack the White House, but the Guardians of the Globe and Nolan Grayson / Omni-Man defeat them and save the President. Mark Grayson, Nolan's son who is still waiting for his powers to emerge, goes to school and defends classmate Amber Bennett from bully Todd, who retaliates by punching Mark to the ground until Amber saves him. Later that night, his superpowers finally emerge and he finishes work to tell his parents at dinner. While Nolan is initially uncertain, he still begins to train Mark on how to use them. However, despite basic instructions and tutorials, Mark is caught off-guard by his father punching too hard, feeling hurt emotionally and physically. Needing to blow off steam, Mark stops a robbery the next day in a homemade suit. After a heart-to-heart with his father, Omni-Man takes him to meet his old friend, superhero suit tailor Art Rosenbaum, who gives Mark a proper suit after he chooses to call himself "Invincible". Later, Omni-Man entraps the Guardians of the Globe and viciously kills them all. Sustaining damage from their resistance, Omni-Man falls unconscious.
