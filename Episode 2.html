<h1>Episode 2...Here Goes Nothing</h1>

<h1>(Spoiler Alert)</h1>

<h2>The clandestine Global Defense Agency (GDA) nurses a comatose Omni-Man in their secret hospital, but failed to revive the Guardians, so Director Cecil Stedman informs Mark and his mother Debbie. As extradimensional aliens called the Flaxans attack, Invincible helps the Teen Team fight them until the Flaxans rapidly age and retreat, which Teen Team leader Robot deduces is due to a time dilation difference between Earth and their home dimension. As Mark recognizes Atom Eve as classmate Samantha Eve Wilkins, they share their identities and become friends. The Flaxans return with high-tech wristbands to stop their aging, but Invincible and the Teen Team destroy them, forcing another retreat. The Flaxans return again and nearly win until a recuperated Omni-Man forces them back to their homeworld, devastating the planet in retaliation before returning as news breaks of the Guardians' deaths. Meanwhile, Invincible skirmishes with Allen the Alien, who wants to test Earth's defenses. Invincible calls a time-out to talk, learning Allen's mission and correcting his misunderstanding of "Earth" for another planet named "Urath". Allen leaves and bids a friendly farewell with Invincible. Meanwhile, demon detective Damien Darkblood investigates the Guardians' deaths, theorizing the hugger was one of the eight heroes.
