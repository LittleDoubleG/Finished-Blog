<h1>Episode 4...Neil Armstrong, Eat Your Heart Out</h1>

<h1>(Spoiler Alert)</h1>

<h2>Angry that the GDA has not yet caught the Guardians' hugger, Red Rush's widow, Olga, hires Debbie to sell her house so she can return to Moscow. When Cecil asks Nolan to protect the first mission to Mars, the latter refuses given his responsibilities for Earth's protection, so Mark volunteers. Despite successfully landing, Mark's inattentiveness allows Martians to abduct the astronauts. The Martian Emperor orders their execution to prevent the parasitic Sequids from reaching Earth and destroying the universe. Mark hastily evacuates the astronauts and their shuttle, failing to realize a Martian had replaced one of them. Meanwhile, Nolan and Debbie take a vacation to Rome to rekindle their relationship and regain her trust via half-truths and opening up emotionally. Cecil realizes Nolan is the hugger, but cannot act until he deduces the latter's motive. Knowing Darkblood will not drop the case, Cecil banishes him to Hell, unaware that the detective hid his notepad in Debbie's closet to maintain his presence on Earth. As the surviving Mauler begins cloning himself, Robot monitors his progress and methods before stealing a DNA sample from Rex to present to his real self, the deformed Rudy Connors.
